CHAPTER 1 : INTRO TO CIRCUIT THEORY 

TOPICS > 

* Define an Active Device vs. a Passive Device

 Active components :

An active device is any type of component with the ability to electrically control the flow of current (electricity controlled by electricity)

Passive components :

 Components incapable of controlling current by means of another electrical signal are called passive devices
